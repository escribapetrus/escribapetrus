What is the primary purpose of an API Gateway?;To manage and route API requests from clients to the appropriate backend services, handling tasks such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, data manipulation, and caching.
Name two key functionalities of an API Gateway.;processing multiple concurrent requestsroute traffic to different servicesauthentication and authorizationmonitoring requests and responsesmanage API contracts and transform data
How does an API Gateway enhance security for backend services?;By enforcing security policies like API key validation, OAuth, and other authentication and authorization mechanisms.
What is the primary purpose of a Load Balancer?;To distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, providing high availability and reliability.
List three load balancing algorithms.;Round-robinleast connectionsIP hash.
What is the role of health checks in load balancing?;To monitor the health of servers and ensure traffic is only directed to healthy servers.
What is the primary purpose of a Reverse Proxy?;To act as an intermediary for requests from clients to servers, providing anonymity, security, and performance enhancements.
How does a Reverse Proxy improve performance?;By caching responses to reduce the load on backend servers and decrease response times.
What layer does an API Gateway typically operate at?;The application layer (Layer 7).
Can a Load Balancer operate at the transport layer?;Yes, a load balancer can operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) for TCP/UDP traffic.
How does a Reverse Proxy enhance security?;By acting as a security barrier, protecting servers from direct exposure to the internet.
What is request aggregation in the context of an API Gateway?;Combining responses from multiple backend services into a single response for the client.
Give two examples of API Gateway services.;NGINX, Kong, AWS API Gateway, Google Apigee
What is the difference between API Gateway and Load Balancer in terms of scope?;An API Gateway routes traffic to multiple services in a distributed system.  A load balancer routes traffic to multiple servers (replicas) of a single service.
What is the primary purpose of the OSI model?;To provide a conceptual framework for understanding and implementing standard protocols in network communications.
Name the seven layers of the OSI model in order from Layer 1 to Layer 7.;PhysicalData Link NetworkTransportSessionPresentationApplication
What is the main function of the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI Model?;Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium.
Which layer of the OS model is responsible for error detection and correction in data packets?;Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
Which OSI model layer manages logical addressing and routing?;Network Layer (Layer 3).
What are the main protocols associated with the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model?;TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
What does the Session Layer (Layer 5) of the OSI model do?;Manages sessions or connections between applications, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions.
Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression?;Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
Name three protocols that operate at the Application Layer of the OSI model (Layer 7).;HTTP/HTTPSFTPSMTPDNSTelnetSSH
What is the primary function of the Data Link Layer of the OSI model (Layer 2)?;Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles MAC addresses, error checking (CRC), and flow control.
What layer of the OSI model is responsible for routing packets across networks?;Network Layer (Layer 3).
How does the Transport Layer (Layer 4) ensure reliable data transfer?;Through segmentation, flow control, error correction, and protocols like TCP.
Which OSI layer provides network services directly to user applications?;Application Layer (Layer 7).
Give an example of a technology that operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1).;Ethernet (physical aspects)USBBluetooth
What is the role of the Presentation Layer (Layer 6) in network communication?;Translates data between the application layer and the network, handling data formats, encryption, and compression.
Which OSI model layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions between applications?;Session Layer (Layer 5).
What does "ingress" refer to in networking?;Ingress refers to the traffic that enters a network or a network device from external sources.
What does "egress" refer to in networking?;Egress refers to the traffic that exits a network or a network device towards external destinations.
What is the main focus of managing ingress traffic?;The main focus is on controlling and securing incoming traffic to ensure that only legitimate and safe data is allowed into the network.
What is the main focus of managing egress traffic?;The main focus is on controlling and securing outgoing traffic to prevent data leaks and ensure internal systems do not communicate with unauthorized external entities.
Give an example of ingress traffic.;Incoming HTTP requests to a web server.
Give an example of egress traffic.;Outgoing HTTP responses from a web server.
What are some common security measures for ingress traffic?;Ingress filtering and firewall rules to block unwanted or harmful traffic.
What are some common security measures for egress traffic?;Egress filtering and firewall rules to prevent data leaks and control what data can leave the network.
What might network administrators monitor ingress traffic for?;To detect and prevent potential threats, such as DDoS attacks.
What might network administrators monitor egress traffic for?;To detect unusual or unauthorized data exfiltration.
What is ingress filtering?;A security measure used to block malicious or unwanted traffic from entering the network.
What is egress filtering?;A security measure used to prevent unauthorized data from leaving the network and to block access to malicious websites.
In what direction does ingress traffic flow?;Into the network or device from external sources.
In what direction does egress traffic flow?;Out of the network or device towards external destinations.
Why is controlling egress traffic important?;To prevent data leaks and ensure that internal systems do not communicate with malicious or unauthorized external entities.
